# My Personal Page

This page is intended to provide some insight on who I am and what some of my public projects are.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, TailwindCSS, JavaScript

The idea of this project is to keep it simple and elegant. No hefty frameworks. I may add a blog in the future.

For now, it's a simple about me page to share some of the projects I'm working on.
